# Dice-Game

Hi, thanks for checking my Dice Game project. 

Languages / Techniques used in this project: HTML, SASS(SCSS), JavaScript, jQuery(3.7.1).

setTimeout/clearTimeout and requestAimationFrame/cancelAnimationFrame are used when creating the animation for changing dice points. setTimeout and clearTimeout is also used for the inital game rules pop-up window.

Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxDicePoint - minDicePoint + 1) + minDicePoint) is used for generating random dice points.

To run the project: download the project and navigate to the "html" folder, double click index.html

Thank you again for your interested.
